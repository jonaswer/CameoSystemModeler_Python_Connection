# CameoSystemsModeler_Python_Connection

Cameo Systems Modeler is a modeling tool for Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) via SysML. This repository is a small introduction for everyone who likes to use the programming language Python to interact with the Cameo Systems Modeler. Therefore Matlab is used as a connection between CSM and Python. The Matlab script works as an contraint of an Internal Block Diagram or a Parametric Diagram. 

Cameo Systems Modeler comes with the possibility to integrate the programming language Jyphon directly, which is a Java implementation of Python. However, it is not possible to use every library or API in Jyphon. Calling Python from Matlab in the console and read the output afterwards is the only opportunity to use Python APIs of FEM Frameworks like Abaqus inside of the Cameo Systems Modeler to automate different simulations in activites of your system model. 

In this small example, Python is used two multiplicate two values with a factor. A .json file is used to store the solutions for Matlab and Cameo System Systems Modeler
